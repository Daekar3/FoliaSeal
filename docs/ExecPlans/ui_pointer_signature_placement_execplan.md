# Pointer-driven signature placement

This ExecPlan is a living document and must be maintained in accordance with
.agents/skills/write-execplan/PLANS.md. It is an AFK (agent can implement and validate without a
pending human product decision) child of
docs/ExecPlans/ui_spec_v1_compliance_parent_execplan.md.

## Purpose / Big Picture

After this slice, a user can pointer-driven one-signature placement with explicit Place mode in the real FoliaSeal GUI. It is mapped to UI_SPEC section 8 and acceptance scenario 3. The
slice is one vertical path through the relevant persistent model,
application workflow, Qt surface, focused tests, and observable acceptance.

## Child ExecPlan Dependencies

- [x] docs/SPEC.md and docs/UI_SPEC.md are frozen governing contracts.
- [ ] docs/ExecPlans/ui_pdf_navigation_zoom_pan_execplan.md, docs/ExecPlans/ui_first_use_preset_setup_execplan.md, and docs/ExecPlans/ui_certificate_selection_readiness_execplan.md

## Progress

- [ ] (2026-08-09) Audit current behavior and add a failing focused test.
- [ ] (2026-08-09) Implement the smallest complete model/application/Qt path.
- [ ] (2026-08-09) Retire migrated compatibility or phase3 product cruft whose consumers are gone.
- [ ] (2026-08-09) Run focused, regression, and GUI validation; clean processes and artifacts.
- [ ] (2026-08-09) Update this plan and relevant docs, then commit.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: pointer placement crosses viewer interaction and signing-draft state; the drag path
  must remain page-local and must not bypass the application placement contract.
  Evidence: the live source paths and focused tests listed below are the audit baseline.

## Decision Log

- Decision: obey SPEC.md, SCHEMAS.md, and UI_SPEC.md in that precedence order.
  Rationale: these are the repository's explicit authority boundaries.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-09 / Codex
- Decision: keep the slice limited to one user-visible pointer-driven signature placement outcome.
  Rationale: narrow changes are independently testable and recoverable.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

Not started. Record the demonstrated behavior, evidence, and remaining gaps at completion.

## Context and Orientation

The relevant code is presentation/qt/viewer_widget.py; viewer interaction/session; signing workspace interaction bridge; coordinate transforms. FoliaSeal is a Python/Qt Linux PDF signing application. The
primary flow is open, review, select reusable setup, place one visible signature, preview
readiness, sign/save, verify, and reopen. V1 excludes tabs, printing, broad PDF editing, cloud
workflow, enterprise trust administration, and multiple pending signatures.

A compatibility surface is an adapter retained only for old callers. “phase3” names identify legacy
evidence/harness infrastructure and must not be introduced into ordinary product UI or new primary
contracts; production backend/evidence imports may be renamed only after a neutral migration proves
the old name is no longer required.

## Change Slice

Primary change class: behavior change. Allowed changes are the named modules, focused tests,
bounded ignored local evidence, and minimum truthful documentation. Do not mix unrelated evidence
rebaselines, V2 features, or packaging work.

## Plan of Work

Make Place Signature a mutually exclusive mode that creates no object on entry, creates a rectangle only after a pointer drag, keeps completed placement visible in every mode, uses visible-page coordinates, and provides handles only while placing. A click alone must not create a signature. Add or preserve typed application and public Qt-port boundaries rather than reaching
through private widgets. Keep schema and terminology aligned with the frozen documents. When a
legacy path is replaced, prove its callers are migrated before deleting it.

## Milestones

Milestone 1 tests pointer coordinate conversion and page-local bounds. Milestone 2 wires drag/drop
placement through the application draft and public viewer port. Milestone 3 proves pointer placement
and undo/recovery in the GUI and records cleanup.

## Concrete Steps

Run from /home/daekar/FoliaSeal.

    rg -n -e 'interaction_mode|signature|mouse|drag|overlay' src/foliaseal/presentation/qt/viewer_widget.py src/foliaseal/application/viewer_interaction_session.py
    .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/unit/test_qt_viewer_widget.py tests/unit/test_viewer_interaction_session.py
    .venv/bin/ruff check src tests
    git diff --check

Run this bounded walkthrough from /home/daekar/FoliaSeal with an isolated configuration root:

    audit_root=$(mktemp -d /tmp/foliaseal-plan-audit-XXXXXX)
    timeout --foreground 30s env QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$audit_root/config" XDG_CACHE_HOME="$audit_root/cache" .venv/bin/python -m foliaseal gui --pdf-path artifacts/preview_sweep_assets/sweep_fixture.pdf || test "$?" -eq 124
    ps -eo pid,cmd | rg 'FoliaSeal|foliaseal|PySide6|pytest' | rg -v 'rg ' || true
    find "$audit_root" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 2 -type f -delete
    rmdir "$audit_root" 2>/dev/null || true

Expected evidence is the stated user-visible behavior plus a mandatory Qt-test or display-backed
walkthrough. Record the exact input sequence, widget state, expected observation, evidence path, and
cleanup result; the bounded timeout is only a lifecycle check.

## Validation and Acceptance

Acceptance is behavioral: A pointer user can enter Place mode, drag one visible rectangle on the current page, adjust it, leave the mode without losing it, and remove it explicitly. Focused tests must pass, shared-code changes must
leave the full suite green, and the GUI audit must record the visible result and cleanup.

## Evidence Record

Before checking this child in the parent, record the governing UI_SPEC requirement, exact focused
test command/result, Place-mode pointer sequence and observed page-local rectangle, evidence path and
cleanup result, and compatibility grep proof.

## Idempotence and Recovery

Use temporary configuration and sibling output paths. If work fails halfway, preserve user PDFs and
drafts, update Progress with completed/remaining work, clean owned processes and artifacts, and
retry from the recorded state. Do not resurrect removed compatibility paths.

## Artifacts and Notes

Record concise output, focused screenshots or JSON under ignored artifacts/when useful, and exact
changed files. Never commit private keys, passwords, generated PDFs, or machine-local absolute paths.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

Use the existing typed application workflows, schema models, persistence stores, and public Qt frame
or workspace ports. Create tests/integration/test_pointer_signature_placement.py for the pointer
walkthrough. The final behavior must be exercised by tests/unit/test_qt_viewer_widget.py,
tests/unit/test_viewer_interaction_session.py, and that integration test. Any temporary adapter must
name its remaining consumer and retirement condition in this plan.

Revision note: 2026-08-09 / Codex
Created as a dependency-ordered child of the approved SPEC/UI_SPEC compliance breakdown.
